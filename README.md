The Socio Economic Assessment is the main tool that allows determining the persons of concern requiring special assistance from the UNHCR. This assessment depends on several critical and dynamic socioeconomic indicators that are supposed to be collected from persons under UNHCR's mandate. This is done usually through a series of questions designed for specific individual or group of individuals.

Mainly we have three group targeted by socio-economic assessment :

•	Individual
•	Household
•	Community

And following steps involved in our assistance delivery process

•	Socio-Economic Assessment

•	Collection socio economic indicators of people living under the same roof.
•	Evaluation of their needs to determine the appropriate assistance such persons.

•	Assistance Delivery

•	Distribution of assistance to people according to the needs defined in the order to reduce their vulnerability degrees

The current Socio-Economic Assessment systems utilized by the UNHCR Partners in Egypt are paper oriented system at different stage of the process and sometime excel sheet is used to achieve some consolidation and reporting task.

Partners in charge of assessment employs different approaches for activities related to assessment of people of concern, we can mainly consider different data management approaches; different format to collect their Data, different level of accuracy, details during Data Entry, different data security protocol, different data quality level. These discrepancies have a serious impact on process and limit the capacity to consolidate report, share data coming from different partners and reduce our decision making capacity. 

Actually, financial and activities reports are shared between UNHCR and partners but that provides just an overview of activities and some difficulties were observed to get in-depth report and organize an analysis on activities conducted by partners and real impact of this activities.

Capacity to exchange data between UNHCR and partners and between partners is one of the main issues   we faced with them during the past year, this have clearly a negative impact on decision making.

Our reporting capacity are also affected we can’t produce information we want on time this affect our capacity to help effectively people of concern.

The proposed system will provide easy-service access and business process support to partners and UNHCR staff and improve workflow for major assessment, assistance delivery and case management functions performed throughout the partners’ staffs and UNHCR Offices. Enhanced interoperability with other partners’ internal and external application systems will provide additional benefits from information sharing, elimination of redundant data entry, and business process improvement.
